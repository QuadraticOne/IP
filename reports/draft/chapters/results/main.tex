\chapter{Results} \label{chapter:results}

A number of experiments were conducted with two broad goals: verifying that at least some of the proposed architecture works on simplified abstract engineering environments, and proving that it has desirable qualities in more complex environments.
Some experiments were also carried out to visualise and explore the latent space mappings in an intuitive way.

\section{Approach verification} \label{section:approachVerification}

\subsection{Distribution distance} \label{subsection:distributionDistance}

Due to the potential issues with minimising KL-divergence discussed in \S\ref{subsection:potentialIssues}, a simplified environment was devised in which the target distribution $\hat{V_c}$ is known.
$\hat{V_c}$ was fixed as a standard normal distribution (constraints were not considered at this stage) and $\hat{V'_c}$ was modelled as a normal distribution whose mean and standard deviation were learned parameters.

Although KL-divergence is analytically tractable for two normal distributions, it was estimated through sampling of $\hat{V'_c}$ as described in \S\ref{subsection:klDivergence}.
Initial standard deviation $\sigma_0$ was always set to $1$, while initial mean $\mu_0$ was varied.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{broadKLDivergence}
    \caption{
        Change in $\mu$ and $\sigma$ over time when training arbitrary normal distributions with different starting means to match the standard normal distribution.
        Training parameters are reproduced in Appendix \ref{appendix:klTrainingParameters}.
    }
    \label{fig:broadKLDivergence}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
The mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ after each batch are shown in Figure \ref{fig:broadKLDivergence}.
Convergence does occur, but the time taken for the mean to approach $0$ appears to increase exponentially as the initial mean moves away from the target.
Two one-dimensional normal distributions whose means only differ by two and whose standard deviations are both one could still be considered to be quite similar, so the experiment was repeated with $\sigma_0=0.1$ for both distributions to better simulate disjoint distributions.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{narrowKLDivergence}
    \caption{
        Change in $\mu$ and $\sigma$ over time when training arbitrary normal distributions with different starting means to match a normal distribution with $\mu=0$ and $\sigma=0.1$. 
        Training parameters are reproduced in Appendix \ref{appendix:klTrainingParameters}.
    }
    \label{fig:narrowKLDivergence}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:narrowKLDivergence} shows that the variables converge at approximately the same rate as when $\sigma_0=1$.
Both $\mu$ and $\sigma$ went to \url{NaN} after the first epoch and so are not shown.
This may well have been caused by an excessively large KL-divergence resulting in exploding gradients due to the limited precision of floating point numbers.

Changing to 64- instead of 32-bit values lends further evidence to this hypothesis, as increasing the precision allowed the $\mu=1.0,2.0$, $\sigma=0.1$ cases to be optimised without numerical errors (Figure \ref{fig:narrowKLDivergenceFloat64}).
Similarly, using 16-bit precision always resulted in \url{NaN} errors occurring.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{narrowKLDivergenceFloat64}
    \caption{
        Change in $\mu$ and $\sigma$ over time when training arbitrary normal distributions with different starting means to match a normal distribution with $\mu=0$ and $\sigma=0.1$. 
        Training parameters are those in Appendix \ref{appendix:klTrainingParameters}, but with 64-bit precision.
    }
    \label{fig:narrowKLDivergenceFloat64}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
It was therefore concluded that minimising KL-divergence is too inconsistent for practical use, as real distributions $-$ which are frequently disjoint $-$ would very likely cause numerical issues due to lack of the required precision.

\subsection{Precision proxy optimisation} \label{subsection:precisionProxyOptimisation}

All experiments in this section used the parameters in Appendix \ref{appendix:precisionOptimisationTrainingParameters}.

Potential issues with directly estimating $\hat{r}$ were discussed in \S\ref{section:neuralNetworkInversion}.
It was also hypothesised that optimising only $\hat{p}$ would result in $g'$ sampling only a small subset of $V_c$.
A short experiment was devised to prove that this is the case and so a substitute for $\hat{r}$ would be needed.
$h$ was defined arbitrarily for $m=1,\;n=0$, described in detail in Appendix \ref{appendix:unimodalCSF}.
A graph of the constraint satisfaction function on $s\in[-1,\;1]$ is shown in Figure \ref{fig:sigmoidBumpFunction}.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sigmoidBumpFunction}
    \caption{
        A test function estimating the probability that a solution satisfies a singular constraint.
    }
    \label{fig:sigmoidBumpFunction}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
Optimising $g'$ against $h(c,s)$ for $\hat{p}$ consistently yields a distribution of generated solutions displayed in Figure \ref{fig:sigmoidBumpHistogram}.
Only considering precision and disregarding recall produces a mapping which is of no use: it always maps to a singular point in spite of the fact that around $15\%$ of the solution space has a constraint satisfaction probability above $0.9$.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sigmoidBumpHistogram}
    \caption{
        Histogram of samples from $\hat{V'_c}$ compared to $h$ after optimising only $\hat{p}$.
    }
    \label{fig:sigmoidBumpHistogram}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
This issue becomes more pronounced when $h$ has two distinct modes (Figure \ref{fig:sigmoidBumpHistogramBimodal}, Appendix \ref{appendix:bimodalCSF}).
While a very high precision is obtained, optimising solely for precision fails to capture the bimodality of $h$ even in a simple environment, confirming that optimisation must take recall into consideration for satisfactory results.

    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sigmoidBumpHistogramBimodal}
    \caption{
        Histogram of samples from $\hat{V'_c}$ compared to $h$ after optimising only $\hat{p}$.
    }
    \label{fig:sigmoidBumpHistogramBimodal}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Pretraining} \label{subsection:pretrainingResults}

All experiments in this section used the parameters in Appendix \ref{appendix:precisionOptimisationTrainingParameters} unless otherwise specified.

Without $\hat{r}$ being tractable, it was suggested that $g'$ be pretrained to ensure that its initial mapping covers as wide a range of $S$ as possible.
This is based on two suppositions: that $g'$ initially only takes samples from an isolated region of $S$; and that a spread-out distribution would explore multiple high-satisfaction regions of $S$, thereby capturing a multimodal $\hat{V'_c}$ even when optimising only for precision.

That the first assumption holds is confirmed trivially by samples from $\hat{V'_c}$ before training (Figure \ref{fig:initialisedGenerator}).
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[a]{1.\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{initialisedGenerator1}
    \end{subfigure}
    \begin{subfigure}[a]{1.\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{initialisedGenerator2}
    \end{subfigure}
    \begin{subfigure}[a]{1.\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{initialisedGenerator3}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{

        4096 histogram samples were taken instead of 256.
    }
\label{fig:initialisedGenerator}
\end{figure}
Pretraining is performed in the same way as normal training, but one of the spread losses $q_\text{id}$ or $q_\text{sep}$ is minimised instead of $\hat{p}$.
Because the spread is a subjective quality which cannot be objectively measured, the success of each spread metric will be judged on whether it enables $g'$ to learn both modes of $\hat{V_c}$ simultaneously.

Below are examples of typical $\hat{V'_c}$ after pretraining with each spread metric.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{identitySpread}
    \caption{
        $\hat{V'_c}$ after pretraining until convergence using $q_\text{id}$.
        4096 histogram samples were taken instead of 256.
    }
    \label{fig:identitySpread}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{separationSpread}
    \caption{
        $\hat{V'_c}$ after pretraining until convergence using $q_\text{sep}$.
    }
    \label{fig:separationSpread}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
Both metrics show signs of causing $g'$ to explore a far greater proportion of $S$ than immediately after initialisation, but also have a tendency to over-explore the boundaries.
This effect is much more pronounced with $q_\text{sep}$.
The true success of each metric, however, is determined by the generator's ability to find different modes when precision is optimised after pretraining.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{identityThenPrecision}
    \caption{
        $\hat{V'_c}$ after pretraining until convergence using $q_\text{id}$, then trained to maximise $\hat{p}$ until convergence.
    }
    \label{fig:identityThenPrecision}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{separationThenPrecision}
    \caption{
        $\hat{V'_c}$ after pretraining until convergence using $q_\text{sep}$, then trained to maximise $\hat{p}$ until convergence.
    }
    \label{fig:separationThenPrecision}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
Comparing Figure \ref{fig:sigmoidBumpHistogramBimodal} to Figures \ref{fig:identityThenPrecision} and \ref{fig:separationThenPrecision} it is clear that pretraining greatly enhances the generator's ability to sample multiple modes.
This comes at a cost, however; while the generator pretrained on $q_\text{id}$ samples approximately equally from both modes, it also frequently samples solutions from between the modes which are unlikely to satisfy $h$.

\subsection{Maximising precision and spread} \label{subsection:maximisingPrecisionAndSpread}

All experiments in this section used the parameters in Appendix \ref{appendix:precisionOptimisationTrainingParameters}.

Another possibility is, after pretraining, to minimise a weighted sum of $\hat{p}$ and $q$, as if the spread loss were a substitute for $\hat{r}$.
Using $q_\text{id}$, this has an intuitive explanation: $q_\text{id}$ penalises the relocation of probability mass between $L$ and $S$, thereby providing an incentive to $g'$ to seek out areas of high satisfaction probability which are more local.

Figure \ref{fig:identityAndPrecision} shows $\hat{V'_c}$ after $q_\text{id}$ pretraining, then training to minimise $\hat{p}+q_\text{id}$ until convergence.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{identityAndPrecision}
    \caption{
        $\hat{V'_c}$ after pretraining, followed by training to maximise $\hat{p}+q_\text{id}$ until convergence.
    }
    \label{fig:identityAndPrecision}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
This is clearly a result superior to any obtained previously, with $\hat{V'_c}$ covering both modes, and almost always in regions with a satisfaction probability above $0.8$.
Solutions less likely to satisfy $h$ are almost never sampled.

\subsection{Constraint embeddings} \label{subsection:constraintEmbeddings}

The only part of the proposed architecture that has yet to be verified is the insertion of constraints in an embedded form at the output layer of the generator.
This is achieved using a generalised alteration of $h$ introduced in Appendix \ref{appendix:bimodalCSF} such that the position of each peak is controlled by one component of $c$.
Code for replicating this function is reproduced in Appendix \ref{appendix:tensorflowCSF} and training was performed with parameters in Appendix \ref{appendix:embedderVerificationParameters}.

Generally, $\hat{V'_c}$ was able to adapt to account for the differences in $h$.
Not only was it often able to distinguish between two modes, but also adjusted its mapping appropriately when the two peaks were near each other and so merged into one mode.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[a]{1.\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{embeddedConstraint1}

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{
        Examples of a generator learning to adjust its mapping to changing constraints.
    }
\label{fig:embeddedConstraintsBimodal}
\end{figure}
Occasionally, when large regions of $S$ did not satisfy $c$, poor mapping choices such as those observed in Figure \ref{fig:embeddedConstraintTooSparse} would occur.
It is hypothesised that these are artefacts of the cost of moving probability mass from one side of $S$ to the other became greater than the gain in precision; this is partially confirmed by observations that this error happened less frequently once $w$ was reduced.

    \caption{

\section{Method properties} \label{section:methodProperties}

The first half of this chapter described experiments performed on abstract, simplified engineering problems to inform the design of the project's deliverable architecture.
The remainder of this chapter will examine that architecture's performance in more depth and in more concrete engineering environments.

\subsection{Expected satisfaction probability} \label{subsection:expectedSatisfactionProbability}

One crucial requirement of the generator is that the solutions it produces should generally have a high satisfaction probability.
The expected satisfaction probability will be used to measure the performance of the generator on various environments, and is calculated by taking the mean across the satisfaction probability, according to $h(c,s)$, of each solution in a sample.
Similarly, the median satisfaction probability is the median of the satisfaction probability of every solution in the sample.

\subsection{Relative density of true solutions} \label{subsection:relativeDensityOfTrueSolutions}

Another requirement of the generator is that it samples from the entire range of viable solutions.
In all further experiments, identity spread is used as a subtitute for the recall due to its intractibility.
For the purposes of evaluating the generator, the relative density of true solutions in the learned viable distribution will be calculated.

Calculating this value requires a sample of solutions from the true viable distribution: this is achieved by fixing the constraint vector, and then sampling from the discriminator using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
The sampled data should be distributed in approximately the same way as $V(c)$ for sufficiently long Markov chains.

Finding the relative density of each of these solutions in the learned viable distribution requires creating an histogram from a large number of samples from the generator (for $m>1$ an $n$-tree is used to adaptively reduce the number of bins needed).
For each true solution sampled from the Markov chain, the smallest bin within the $n$-tree containing that solution is found.
The relative density of that solution is then defined as the ratio of proportion of generator-sampled points in that bin to the proportion of the volume of the solution space which is bounded by that bin.

Intuitively, if a solution has a relative density greater than $1$ then it is being sampled more frequently than it would be if the generator simply output a uniform distribution; conversely, a relative density of less than $1$ suggests it is being sampled less frequently.
For a generator with good recall it could therefore be expected that the mean relative density over a sample of points taken from the true viable distribution by a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm should be above $1$.

\subsection{Data collection} \label{subsection:dataCollection}

All environments used in further experiments implemented a common interface that allowed the training of a generator upon them to output a large JSON file containing data about the experiment parameters and results.
An exemplar JSON file is shown in the appendix, but the results were not reproduced here in full due to their excessive size.
Unless otherwise stated: the generator consists of two hidden layers with 4 leaky-ReLU units and a single tanh output unit; the weight and bias constraint embedder also have two hidden layers with 4 leaky-ReLU units and 2 leaky-ReLU output units; pretraining is performed to minimise $q_\text{id}$ and then full training is performed to minimise a weighted sum of the precision proxy and $q_\text{id}$, both until convergence.

\subsection{Effect of recall weight} \label{subsection:effectOfRecallWeight}

A generator was trained on a more concrete engineering environment to examine the effect of tuning $w$ on the tradeoff between precision and recall.
It is hypothesised that low $w$ causes high satisfaction probability but low relative density, whereas high $w$ causes the opposite.

The engineering environment consists of a square plate with sides two units long whose origin is at its centre.
Two holes are drilled into the plate, each described by the coordinates of their centre (which may be anywhere on the plate) and their radius (which may be in $[0,1]$).
One of the hole's parameters are fixed; this hole is taken to be the constraint.
The other hole's parameters are varied as the parameters of the solution.
Satisfaction of the constraint occurs when the holes do not overlap.
As such, $m=n=3$.

Datasets of 64, 256, and 1024 $(s,c,h(c,s))$ tuples were created to train the discriminator, each balanced such that roughly half of the examples satisfied the constraint.
Samples were taken uniformly from $S$ and $C$, and the satisfaction probability was calculated for each pair.
One hidden layer of four leaky-ReLU nodes was used for the discriminator.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{solutionPropertiesEvenlyWeighted}
    \caption{
        The median and interquartile range of the satisfaction probability and relative density of 128 generated and 128 true solutions to a sample of constraints.

        Relative density is given as $\log_2(\rho+1)$ to space the data while conserving the important lines $\rho=0$ and $\rho=1$.
    }
    \label{fig:solutionPropertiesEvenlyWeighted}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
Immediately noticeable is the very high precision: only one of the constraints has a satisfaction probability of under $0.8$ for at least half of its generated solutions.
Recall is generally quite poor, however.
Only a small proportion of the true solutions were sampled more frequently by the generator than by a uniform distribution.
It was hypothesised that increasing $w$ would shift the constraints to regions of higher relative density, at the cost of slightly decreasing the precision of the generator.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{solutionPropertiesW3}
    \caption{
        The median and interquartile range of the satisfaction probability and relative density of 128 generated and 128 true solutions to a sample of constraints.
        Generator trained with $w=3$.
    }
    \label{fig:solutionPropertiesW3}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:solutionPropertiesW3} shows this to be partially incorrect, however; while a reduction in satisfaction probability is observed, increasing $w$ does not appear to have increased the relative density for the majority of constraints.
But the spread loss does appear to be consistently reduced by increasing $w$ (Table \ref{table:generatorTrainingProgression}), suggesting that $q_\text{id}$ is not an accurate gauge of recall.
That increasing $w$ did trade precision for spread does suggest, however, that if a feasible estimate for recall could be obtained, tuning $w$ would have the intuitive effect hypothesised previously.

    \label{table:separationTrainedGeneratorSamples}
\end{table}

\subsection{Equality constraints} \label{subsection:equalityConstraints}

A constraint found commonly in engineering problems is an equality constraint, specifying that some property must equal a particular value.
Such a constraint can be created using the current architecture by parameterising the constraint such that it describes the upper and lower acceptable bounds on a property, and then setting these two bounds to be arbitrarily close together.

The Branin function, $\beta(x,y)$, was chosen to test the ability of the generator to approximate equality constraints as it is a standard test function for which an equality constraint produces distinct contours.
Having a solution dimension of $2$ also makes visualisation of the results possible.
To make passing the function and its arguments into the discriminator possible, both inputs and the output were scaled to be in $[0,\;1]$.
The constraint vector, in two dimensions, was then defined such that the constraint is considered satisfied when:
\begin{equation}
    c_1\cdot c_2\le\beta(x,y)\le c_2,\quad c_1,c_2\;\in\;[0,\;1]
\end{equation}
and so:
\begin{equation}
    h(c,s)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\text{satisfied}&\mbox{if }c_1\cdot c_2\le\beta(s_1,s_2)\le c_2\\\text{unsatisfied}&\mbox{otherwise}\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
As with the environment in \S\ref{subsection:effectOfRecallWeight}, datasets of various sizes were created and a discriminator and generator were trained on the resulting data.
The generator seemed to produce good solutions over a large range of the true viable space for most constraints, but was unable to find solutions to some constraints, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:braninPropertiesW3}.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{braninPropertiesW1}
    \caption{
        Solutions which produce values within certain bounds when passed through the Branin function, as sampled by $5$ instances of a generator.
        The discriminator was trained with one hidden layer, while the generator and constraint embedders each had two, all of which had 32 leaky-ReLU activated nodes.
        Identity spread loss was used as a substitute for recall with $w=1$.
    }
    \label{fig:braninPropertiesW3}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
After training, the constraint $c=[0.5,\;0.5]$ was chosen, corresponding to regions of the solution space for which the altered Branin function outputs values in $[0.25,\;0.5]$.
Samples were then drawn from the learned viable distribution and plotted in the solution space, with overlays for the output of the discriminator and the true constraint satisfaction function, in Figure \ref{fig:equality05}.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{equality05}
    \caption{
        1024 sample solutions, high-likelihood regions of the discriminator, and the regions containing true solutions for a generator trained on the constrained Branin function environment.
        $c=[0.5\;0.5]$.
    }
    \label{fig:equality05}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
It is immediately clear that the vast majority of sampled solutions lie within regions of $S$ which the discriminator predicts are likely to satisfy the constraint satisfaction function.
Note also that the discriminator appears to have sharp edges (the cyan region in Figure \ref{fig:equality05} is thin compared to the blue region) and is generally accurate in its prediction of the boundaries of the viable space.
While the points are spread out sufficiently to cover a wide range of the viable space and avoid coalescing into peaks, there are also regions near the periphery of the viable space which are undersampled, suggesting that some precision could be traded for an increase in recall.

Increasing $c_1$ to $0.7$, constraining the viable space to those solutions for which $0.35\le\beta(s_1,s_2)\le0.5$, yields similar results (Figure \ref{fig:equality07}).
\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}

The discriminator's predictions appear to be becoming less accurate as the bounded constraint approaches an equality constraint, failing to recognise that solutions near the origin do not satisfy the constraint.
While the discriminator made similar misclassifications for $c=[0.5,\;0.5]$, the error is now affecting the learned viable distribution to the extent that a large number of samples are drawn from a region outside the true viable space.

Finally, $c_1$ was increased to $0.9$, representing regions for which $0.45\le\beta(s_1,s_2)\le0.5$, effectively approaching an equality constraint (Figure \ref{fig:equality09}).
Of the two modes in the true viable space, one is fairly consistently sampled by the learned viable distribution, while the other is missed almost entirely.
It should be noted, however, that the generator has learned to sample high-likelihood regions of the discriminator, but that the discriminator misclassified the mode closer to the origin.
This presents promising evidence that, with further refinement of the discriminator, this architecture could be used to accurately sample equality constraints.

\section{Latent space visualisation} \label{section:latentSpaceVisualisation}

To gain an intuitive understanding of how the generator maps the latent space to the solution space, a tool was written to plot invariants of each dimension of the latent space in the solution space.
The viable space was overlayed onto these plots.
Because both its solution and constraint spaces are two-dimensional, the Branin function environment was considered the most apt for visualisation purposes, and so the generator trained in that environment was used.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{latentPlot0803}
    \caption{
        Latent invariants in the solution space of the Branin environment for $c=[0.8,\;0.3]$.
    }
    \label{fig:latentPlot0803}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:latentPlot0803} shows a highly constrained case where two distinct, narrow bands of viable solutions exist.
As expected given previous results, the latent space is highly compressed within these two regions, with an exceptionally sparse area in between them.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{latentPlot0407}
    \caption{
        Latent invariants in the solution space of the Branin environment for $c=[0.4,\;0.7]$.
    }
    \label{fig:latentPlot0407}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
The near-equality constraint is relaxed somewhat in Figure \ref{fig:latentPlot0407}, giving way to much larger areas of viable solutions.
The latent space is, correctly, more spread out in this plot, but some parts of the solution space $-$ including some viable solutions $-$ exist completely outside the latent space.
This might explain why, in \S\ref{subsection:effectOfRecallWeight}, so many true solutions were found to have no likelihood of occurring in the set of generated solutions.

    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{latentPlot0000}
    \caption{
        Latent invariants in the solution space of the Branin environment for $c=[0.0,\;0.0]$, a degenerate case with no solutions.
    }
    \label{fig:latentPlot0000}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
For the sake of completeness, Figure \ref{fig:latentPlot0000} shows the behaviour of the latent space in a degenerate case with no solutions.
Far fewer sparse regions appear here than in the other examples, with the entirety of the latent space relatively compressed.
It also appears to frequently overlap itself, a phenomena not frequently seen for other constraints.

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{latentPlot0001}
    \caption{
        Latent invariants in the solution space of the Branin environment for $c=[0.0,\;0.1]$.
    }
    \label{fig:latentPlot0001}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
Finally, Figure \ref{fig:latentPlot0001} shows a fairly lenient case with a ride range of potential solutions.
Here, the lack of recall is particularly evident, with relatively few of the potential solutions having latent equivalents in spite of the fact that most of the latent space maps to a viable solution.
